# A-ChatBot-trained-with-SGB
<p>This is my first ChatBot that can have some easy conversations. 
<p>Run the code in the ipynb in your own jupyter notebook, then you will be able to generate the trained chatbot in the same file with this notebook, remember to download the intent.json file, feel free to add more responses and intent in it. You can always add more data to json file to improve the accuracy
<p>You can do basic greeting or ask it to tell you some jokes or gossip!
